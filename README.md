This is a (somewhat) recreation of a game I heard about in a GDC talk I heard a few years ago that i could not get out of my head.

The original name cited in the talk was **Tank Turns Tactics** and the basic rules are as follows:
+ Each player gains one energy per day
+ You may move in a 3x3 area centered around yourself at the cost of one energy
+ Each player has three health
+ You may attack another player for one health at the cost of one energy in a 5x5 area around the player
+ You may also give your energy to another player in the same 5x5 area
+ Dead players form a jury
+ Every day the jury votes for alive players that they want to support and whoever gets the most support from the jury gains one extra energy

While I am by no means good nor competent in any of the areas that are required, I've already learnt a lot and it's been pretty fun so far. Here's hoping i don't give up on this one :/
